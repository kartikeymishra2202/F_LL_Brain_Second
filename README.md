🚀 What is Second Brain?
Second Brain is a full-stack application that helps you store, categorize, and retrieve important URLs — currently focusing on YouTube and Twitter links, with future plans for full browser extension support and bookmarking any kind of content.

Designed with scalability and user productivity in mind, the app is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with TypeScript for type safety and Tailwind CSS for modern styling.

🔑 Key Features
🔗 Save YouTube & Twitter Links: Paste a link and store it with metadata (title, source, etc.).

📚 Organized by Type & Tags: Classify saved links for easy filtering and navigation.

🔍 Search & Filter: Quickly find previously saved content.

👤 Authentication: Secure user login/signup using JWT.

☁️ Fully Deployed: Live backend and frontend deployments.

🔧 Built for Extension: Future-ready backend designed to support a browser extension for capturing any URL.

🎯 Built with TypeScript: Ensures better maintainability and developer experience.
